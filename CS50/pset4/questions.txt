0.  In a bitmap file on a disk or a bitmap image in memory, the pixels can be defined by a varying number of bits.
    The 1 bit per pixel (1bpp) format supports 2 distinct colors.
    The 2 bit per pixel (2bpp) format supports 4 distinct colors.
    The 4 bit per pixel (4bpp) format supports 16 distinct colors.
    The 8 bit per pixel (8bpp) format supports 256 distinct colors.
    The 16 bit per pixel (16bpp) format supports 65536 distinct colors.
    The 24 bit per pixel (24bpp) format supports 16,777,216 distinct colors.
    The 32 bit per pixel (32bpp) format supports 4,294,967,296 distinct colors.
1.  GIF format supports animation.
2.  In information technology lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact 
    approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. On the other hand lossless compression or reversible compression
    which does not degrade the data. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is often much higher than through lossless
    techniques.
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed image format.
4.  In most cases, however, delete or erase commands do not actually remove the file’s information from the hard disk. 
    Although the precise notion of “erase” depends on the file system used, in most cases, deleting a file most often merely 
    rewrites the metadata that pointed to the file, but leaves the disk blocks containing the file’s contents intact.
5.  If all the addressable block in a hard disk is filled with ASCII NUL bytes (zeroes).
    Basically overwrite the blocks with zeroes so that the main data couldn’t be recovered.
6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18
    to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types,
    together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.
7.  uint8_t is an unsigned integer type which is 8 bits.It can store numbers from number range 0 to 255.
    uint32_t is an unsigned integer type which is 32 bits.It can store numbers from number range 0 to 4,294,967,295.
    int32_t is an signed integer type which is 32 bits.It can store numbers from number range −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
    uint16_t is an unsigned integer type which is 16 bits.It can store numbers from number range 0 to 65,535.
    To work with these range of numbers the above data type uint8_t,uint32_t,int32_t,uint16_t would come in handy.
8.  A BYTE is an 1 byte(8-bit) unsigned value that corresponds to a single octet in a network protocol.
    A DWORD is a 4 bytes(32-bit) unsigned integer (range: 0 through 4294967295 decimal). 
    A LONG is a 4 bytes(32-bit) signed integer, in twos-complement format (range: –2147483648 through 2147483647 decimal). 
    A WORD is a 2 bytes(16-bit) unsigned integer (range: 0 through 65535 decimal).
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be the 14 and 40. Which corresponds to BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER.
10. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure and bfsize is Size of the BMP file.
11. If the biHeight value is negative uncompressed bitmaps can be stored from the top to bottom.
12. biBitCount.
13. fopen might return NULL if operating system is out of memory.
    or if we try to open a file in a directory for which we didn’t have the proper permissions.
14. fread's third argument 1 means it is reading x amount of bytes 1 times. 
    For example fread(p,x,1,in) here x is the amount of bytes and that amount of byte has been read one times. 
15. 3
16. fseek function moves the cursor in a file to a desired byte location.
17. SEEK_CUR is move from current position of the file to required bytes position.
