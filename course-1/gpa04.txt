Problem Definition: A rational number is represented as numerator / denominator.  We need to identify whether two rational numbers are equal or not. For example, consider two rational numbers '1 / 4' and '4 / 16'. Both of them are equal, as, '4 / 16' if reduced to lowest terms is '1 / 4'.

Consider the following structure 'rational' that has member variables 'numerator' and 'denominator'.

struct rational { 
   int numerator; 
   int denominator; 
} ;

You are required to write 2 functions:
Function 1: reduce

This function has two parameters:

struct rational *inputrational: *inputrational is a pointer to the structure rational, which is the actual rational number to be reduced
struct rational *outputrational: *outputrational is a pointer to the structure rational, which will store the rational number in its lowest form
The function should do the following

It should reduce the number i.e. numerator and denominator to its lowest form, where the original number is stored in inputrational
The reduced (output) number should be stored in outputrational.
The function is given below, in which you need to write your code

void reduce(struct rational *inputrational, struct rational *outputrational) {

}

Function 2: equal
This function has two parameters:

struct rational *rational_number1: *rational_number1 is a pointer to the structure rational, which denotes the first rational number
struct rational *rational_number2: *rational_number2 is a pointer to the structure rational, which denotes the second rational number
Note: The parameters given above are incorrect. It should be as follows
   1. struct rational num1
 2. struct rational num2

The function should do the following

This function should call the function 'reduce' twice. The first time with the first rational number, and the second time, with the second rational number.
Thereafter, the function should check whether both the rational numbers obtained in the lowest form are equal or not. If yes, then it should return boolean value 'true', else, it should a boolean value 'false'.
The function is given below, in which you need to write your code

     bool equal (struct rational *rational_number1, struct rational *rational_number2) {

     }
Note: The function definition given above is incorrect. It should be as follows:
      bool isEqual(struct rational num1, struct rational num2) {
            //Write your solution code below this line

      }

In the 'main' program, the function 'equal' is called using two arguments, num1 and num2 which are  passed by reference, both of type 'struct rational'
