Problem Definition:  A stock market is a place where sellers (usually companies) sell their stocks (shares) and buyers (usually individuals) buy the stocks (shares) from the market. A person buys a stock from the stock market, of a particular company, and then sells it (usually at a higher price, to earn profit). Consider an example, that the person bought one share of a company at Rs. 44,000/- and sold at Rs. 54,000/-, the profit earned is Rs. 10,000/-. A similar example, where the profit can be denoted as loss, is that the person bought a share at Rs. 54,000/- and sold at Rs.44,000/-, then, the profit earned is Rs. -10,000/- (i.e. loss of Rs. 10,000/-). 

Assumptions:  The following are the assumptions for this programming assignment.

The price of a single share of a company is stored in array called 'prices[ ]'.
Working days are Mon to Fri, which are denoted as numbers from 0 to 4 (index numbers). This means that  'prices[3]' contains the price of a share, of a company on Thursday i.e. 3rd day. (Note: Index starts from 0, which denotes Monday).
A person can buy only one share of a company. 
There is only one week (5 days) for the (mentioned above), during a which transaction (buying and selling can take place) i.e. buying and selling has to take place during these 5 days only. Selling of a share cannot be carried forward to another week, as only one week is allotted. 
A person can buy a share on any day, and can sell on any day, provided (day of selling > day of buying) i.e. it is impossible that the person sells a share before actually buying it.
The price is in integer format. Price in decimal format is not considered.
Task:  In this programming assignment, you are required to write code, to find out the maximum profit (positive or negative) that can be earned, during the week given, by a buyer.

Example 1: The array 'prices[ ]' contains:  44000, 54000, 46000, 47000, 48000
In this example, if the buyer, buys a share on Monday i.e. at the rate of Rs. 44,000/-, and sells it on Tuesday, at the rate of Rs. 54,000/- the profit earned would be Rs. 10,000/-. A profit of Rs. 10,000/- cannot be earned on any other occassions. For example, if the buyer buys the share on Wednesday, i.e. at the rate of Rs. 46,000/- and sells it at the rate of Rs. 48,000/- on Friday, the profit earned is just Rs. 2,000/-, which is definitely less than Rs. 10,000/-. This is true for all other days too. Hence, the maximum profit that can be earned is Rs. 10,000/-

Example 2: The array 'prices[ ]' contains:  67000, 73000, 57000, 63000, 47000
In this example, if the buyer buys a share on Monday, at the rate of Rs. 67,000/-, and sells it on Tuesday, at the rate of Rs. 73,000/-, then the profit earned would be Rs. 6,000/-. The same profit is earned if the buyer buys a share on Wednesday at the rate of RS. 57,000/-, and sells it on Thursday, at the rate of Rs. 63,000/-. On no other occassion, the profit earned is more than Rs. 6,000/-. Hence, 6000 is the answer.

Example 3: The array 'prices[ ]' contains:  55000, 55000, 55000, 55000, 55000
In this example, if the buyer buys a share on any day, and sells the same on any day, the profit earned would be Rs.0/-, since the price of the share is the same on all days. Since, it is compulsory to buy and sell a share, the maximum profit that can be earned is 0. 

Example 4: The array 'prices[ ]' contains:  87000, 67000, 45000, 34000, 33000
In this example, irrespective of the buying and selling day, the profit earned would definitely be negative (i.e. loss). The maximum profit (in this case, the minimum damage) earned is, when the buyer, buys the share on Thursday at Rs. 34,000/- and sells it on Friday, at the rate of Rs. 34,000/-, which is Rs. -1,000/-. Hence, the maximum profit (minimum loss) is -1000.

You are required to do the following:

Write code to find the maximum profit that can be earned (as described above) and return its value.
