Practice Programming Assignment (PPA 03)
Happy Numbers: A number is called a happy number, if you repeat the process, of squaring the sum of the digits, till the value 1 is obtained. E.g. You need to do the following to perform this check: (a) compute the sum of the squares of its digits (b) if the resultant value is 1, then the number is a happy number, else execute point (a). If a number is not a happy number, there will be an endless loop/cycle to this execution. 

Task: In this programming assignment, you are required to write code that checks whether the number is a happy number or not, for 10 cycles (iterations) only. 2 examples of happy numbers (limited to 10 cycles ) are given below:

Example 1: Assume a number '19'

Number	Computation	Result	Cycle / Iteration
19	92 + 12	82	1
82	22 + 82	68	2
68	82 + 62	100	3
100	02 + 02 + 12	1	4
Stop computing further, as the Result obtained is 1. Hence, the number '19', is a happy number. We achieved this in 4 cycles only.
 Example 2: Assume a number '3'

Number	Computation	Result	Cycle
3	32 	9	1
9	92 	81	2
81	12 + 82	65	3
65	52 + 62	61	4
61	12 + 62	37	5
37	72 + 32	58	6
58	82 + 52	89	7
89	92 + 82	145	8
145	52 + 42 + 12	42	9
42	22 + 42	20	10
Stop computing further, as we are allowed to compute for 10 cycles only. The resultant value after computing 10 cycles is 20
  You are required to do the following:

Find the sum of the digits of the number.
Check the result obtained in point 1. If it is 1, assign value 1 to the variable 'finalNumber', else again execute point 1, till the number obtained is 1 or till the number of cycle increases to 10.
Assign the iteration value to the variable 'cycle_no'.
Click on the next unit (visible at the top of your screen), to follow the instructions and write your code in the space provided.

Note: The 3 points given above should be read as:

Find the sum of the squares of the digits of a number.
Check the result obtained in point 1. If it is 1, assign value 1 to the variable 'finalNumber'. If it is not 1, then again execute point 1, till the number obtained is 1 or till the number of cycle increases to 10. Finally assign the resultant value obtained to the variable 'finalNumber'
Assign the iteration value to the variable 'cycle_no'.
